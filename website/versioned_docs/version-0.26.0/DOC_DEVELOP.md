## Developing ReNative Locally

If you need full control over whole ReNative build you can clone and develop it locally

```
1) clone git@github.com:pavjacko/renative.git
2) cd renative
3) npm i
4) npm run watch
5) npm run link
```


At this point your global `$ rnv` command is linked directly into project above.

It's also best way to contribute back to RNV! :)


```
rnv template apply
=> pick renative-template-hello-world
```
